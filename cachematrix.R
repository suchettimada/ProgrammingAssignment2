## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

#Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
#to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 
#Below pair of functions caches the inverse of a matrix.

## Write a short comment describing this function

#makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  
  
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)


## Write a short comment describing this function

#cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
#makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
#then the cachesolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
